 This code simulates the development of LPO textures in a deforming
 olivine aggregate. This is a modified version of the popular fortran code
 D-Rex, originally released by Ed Kaminski, Neil Ribe, and others. 
 
 The code has been modified from the original fortran version. This
 version of the code only tracks the development of crystal sizes and
 orientations. All path-line integration and seismic anistropy
 calculations present in the original fortran version have been removed.
 All calculations relating to enstatite have also been removed. The
 code is suitable for simulating olivine fabrics, and can easily be
 modified for calculating fabric development for a given velocity field.
 
 Other modifications include:
 1. The initially random LPO is now generated using a random stream, and
 follows the method in Morawiec, A. (2003). Orientations and rotations.
 Springer-Verlag.
 2. The code warns the user when the rotation matrix used to update a
 crystal orientation is not a proper rotation matrix. 
 3. An indexing error in the original fortran code related to the
 calculation of dislocation densities has be fixed. 
 
 The theoretical development of the model is described in the following
 publications: 
 Kaminski, E., & Ribe, N. M. (2001). A kinematic model for 
 recrystallization and texture development in olivine polycrystals.
 Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 189(3), 253-267.

 USAGE
 
 INPUT: 
 The code does not require input arguments and can be run by
 calling the program the commandline or pushing the green "Run" button.
 The user specifies two types of parameters in the following sections. The
 first type of parameters relates to the olivine aggregate, such as the
 number of olivine crystals and the stress exponent. These parameters are
 defined in the next section as part of the "Grain" structure. Default
 values and alternative options are also discussed.
 
 The second type of input parameter relates to the imposed deformation.
 The user may choose from among the pre-defined deformation gradient
 tensors by setting the "deformationSymmetry" variable to one of the
 following strings: axisymmetricCompression, axisymmetricExtension,
 orthorhombic, simpleShear, triclinic, or noDeformation. Custom
 deformation gradient tensors can also be added in the section labelled
 "Define Deformation Gradient Tensor". The number of integration steps
 must also be specified.
 
 OUTPUT:
 The code outputs several text files and figures. Five text files are
 created. The first is an info file that lists important parameters and
 final finite strain results for the aggregtate. The second text file
 lists the final orientations (ZXZ, Bunge convention, in radians),
 and the volume fraction of each crystal. Three other text files are
 also output that contain only euler angles. The unweighted file includes
 a single measurement for all crystals that have volume fraction greater
 than zero. This is akin to making a single measurement of each grain. The
 volume weighted file includes repeated measurements for the same grain scaled by the final volume fraction. 
 This is akin to making measurements on a predefined grid. The inverse
 volume weighted file includes repreate measurements for each grain
 
 The code also outputs a figure containing pole figures for the
 [100],[010], and [001] axes. The default coordinate frame for the pole
 figures is defined as follows:

<pre>                 
                %%%     %%%
           %%%              %%%
     
       %%%                      %%%
     
      %%%                         %%%
     %              +Z             +X % 
      %%%                         %%%
     
      %%%                        %%%
      
         %%%                  %%%
         
               %%%  +Y  %%%
</pre>               
 The pole figures are saved using the export_fig toolbox. A version of this
 toolbox is included.
